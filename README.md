## Usage
Built files are present in `bin/` directory. The following table lists all outputted programs:

| Binary | Usage | Description |
| -- | -- | -- |
| dp | `./dp < input > output` | solve task using dynamic-programming approach |
| graph | `./graph < input > output` | solve task using graphs approach |
| gen | `./gen <size> > output` | generate test case of given size |
| tests | `./tests` | run a few predefined tests |
| timer | `./timer <threads>` | benchmark algoritm on given amount of threads |
